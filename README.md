# Data Preparation for Dengue Mortality Project

This repository contains the data preparation and feature engineering steps for dengue mortality and related exogenous variables in Brazil. The main goal is to provide a transparent overview of the data cleaning, merging, and transformation process used to generate the dataset for further modeling and analysis.

## Contents
- Jupyter Notebook(s) with all data preparation steps
- Scripts for merging, cleaning, and transforming data
- Example outputs (not included in repo, see .gitignore)

## How to Use
- Open the main notebook (`lastversioncnpqmegatron.ipynb`) to follow the data preparation pipeline step by step.
- All code is in Python and uses pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, and other common libraries.
- The repo is not meant to be a full-featured package, but a reference for data preparation.

## Notes
- Output files (CSVs, models, etc.) are ignored by default in `.gitignore`.
- This is a side repo for data prep only. Main modeling and results are in a separate repository.
